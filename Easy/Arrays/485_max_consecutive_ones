# Notes
# Initialize two counters, one for the current count of consecutive 1s and one for the maximum found so far.
# Iterate through the array, incrementing the current counter when a 1 is found and resetting it when a 0 is found.
# Update the maximum counter whenever the current counter exceeds it.
# Return the maximum counter after the loop ends.
